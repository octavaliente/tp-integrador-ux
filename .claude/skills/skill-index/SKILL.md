Trigger whenever the user wants a new blank Figma file — a new design, FigJam, or Slides file — or when you need a fresh file before calling `use_figma`. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard, /figma-create-new-file slides Q3 Review)",

      "type": "skill-md",
      "description": "Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code', 'convert this modal/dialog/drawer/panel to Figma'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, modal, dialog, drawer, sidebar, panel, or any composed multi-section view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles from Code Connect files, existing screens, and library search, then imports them and assembles views incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values.",

      "name": "figma-generate-diagram",
      "type": "skill-md",
      "description": "MANDATORY prerequisite — load this skill BEFORE every `generate_diagram` tool call. NEVER call `generate_diagram` directly without loading this skill first. Trigger whenever the user asks to create, generate, draw, render, sketch, or build a diagram — flowchart, architecture diagram, sequence diagram, ERD or entity-relationship diagram, state diagram or state machine, gantt chart, or timeline. Also trigger when the user mentions Mermaid syntax or wants a system architecture, decision tree, dependency graph, API call flow, auth handshake, schema, or pipeline visualized in FigJam. Routes to type-specific guidance, sets universal Mermaid constraints, and tells you when to use a different diagram type or skip the tool entirely (mindmaps, pie charts, class diagrams, etc.).",

      "name": "figma-generate-library",
      "type": "skill-md",
      "description": "Build or update a professional-grade design system in Figma from a codebase. Use when the user wants to create variables/tokens, build component libraries, create individual components with proper variant sets and variable bindings, set up theming (light/dark modes), document foundations, or reconcile gaps between code and Figma. Also use when the user asks to create or generate any component in Figma — even a single one — since components require proper variable foundations, variant states, and design token bindings to be production-quality. This skill teaches WHAT to build and in WHAT ORDER — it complements the `figma-use` skill which teaches HOW to call the Plugin API. Both skills should be loaded together.",

Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.",
